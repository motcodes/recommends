Recently I came across a few Tweets where people discussed how much knowledge a web developer should have about HTML,
since a lot of recruiters don't list it as mandatory skill anymore.
And people got furios about it, because if you don't know how to write good and semantic HTML (which is a must for a web developer) you will not make it as a web dev.  
So here I am, trying to list useful links about it.
