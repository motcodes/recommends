Typography is currently playing a central role in web design, with progressive improvements like Variable Fonts, CSS Shapes, FlexBox, CSS Grids and Subgrid definitively changing the way we work with typography in web design.
More than 57% of all websites use custom fonts and the number is growing every year. The other "half" uses Web Safe / System Fonts, like Arial, Helvetica and Georgia, which are installed on every computer.
What font you use will impact the personality of your product massively.  
For example a Serif font is often used to express exclusiveness, professionalism, high quality. You see it a lot on clothing brands like Calvin Klein or Victoria's Secret.
A Sans-Serif Font is associated with modernness, timelessness, cleanness and stableness. You see it a lot on the web, because it's easier to read than a Serif font in the online world.
Other types are Script, Display, Monospace, and more.

## Icons

Icons are one letter Words. They are used to represent actions, objects, and concepts. Everybody (who has a smartphone at least) knows the WiFi icon and based on the current state of the icon, we are able to tell if we have a strong connection or not.
Based alone on three or four line, we know what it means us. Icons are helpful as long as their context makes sense.
There are now some "universal" icons that everyone in the online world and beyond is familiar with, and just to name a few: Hamburger, Bluetooth, Bookmark, Loading, Map-Pin, Speaker, and many more.
