CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document and it describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
Every Web Developer has to know how to use it but can be confusing for new developers, since you need to remember a whole bunch of properties and values.
You need to remember when to use what and how to combine the properties.
Thankfully for us, there are a lot of tools that help you with this.

## Preprocessors

I would recommend to look into the [BEM](http://getbem.com/)-Syntax before starting with Sass or other Preprocessors and CSS-Frameworks.
Writing all classes with the BEM-Syntax is a lot more readable and easier to maintain and definitely helps writing reusable code.

### Sass/Scss

Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.  
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

### PostCss

a tool that allows you to write CSS in a way that is more maintainable, DRYer, and more future-friendly.  
[PostCss](http://postcss.org/)

### Less

a CSS extension language that adds power and simplicity to the CSS language.  
[Less](http://lesscss.org/)

### Stylus

a CSS extension language that removes the curly braces and lets you write CSS in a very similar to Sass syntax.  
[Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/)
